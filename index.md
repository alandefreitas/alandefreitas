<h3 class="fw-bold">Welcome to my personal website 👋</h3>

<br/>
<br/>

💻 I've been developing open-source libraries and tools for the C++ ecosystem, particularly focused on foundational
scientific computing and networking. This is my [GitHub Profile](https://github.com/alandefreitas). Feel free to fork
projects, raise issues and submit PRs.

🔭 My most well-known libraries are probably [Matplot++](https://github.com/alandefreitas/matplotplusplus)
and [Boost.URL](https://github.com/boostorg/url) and some of my recent research involves data structures for Pareto
fronts and symbolic evolutionary algorithms.

👨‍🔬 I'm a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering, in the field of Computational Intelligence. I also have an M.S. and
B.S. in Computer Science. I specialized
in [evolutionary computation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_computation) 🦎
and [computational intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_intelligence) 🧠 in general.

👨‍💻 Previously I was a researcher at the [Rolls-Royce Control & Systems University Technology
Centre](https://www.rolls-royce.com/about/our-research/research-and-university.aspx) ✈️ and
a [Marie Curie researcher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie_Sk%C5%82odowska-Curie_Actions) within the [Seventh
Framework Program](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/de/MEMO_16_146) of
the [European Commission](https://ec.europa.eu/info/index_en) 🇪🇺, when I
developed the method of [Aggregation Trees](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0020025514011347) for
the design of aircraft engines. I have also taught several introductory and advanced programming courses in C++ at
undergraduate and graduate programs, and science methods at graduate programs.

🤸 When not programming I enjoy cooking 👨‍🍳, playing the guitar 🎸, and spending time with the dog 🦮.
